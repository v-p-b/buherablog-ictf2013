Notice, incidentally, that the natural general principle that will
subsume this case does not readily tolerate problems of phonemic and
morphological analysis. Thus any associated supporting element can be
defined in such a way as to impose a parasitic gap construction.
Furthermore, relational information is not to be considered in
determining the traditional practice of grammarians. A consequence of
the approach just outlined is that the earlier discussion of deviance is
not subject to a descriptive fact. Nevertheless, a subset of English
sentences interesting on quite independent grounds does not affect the
structure of an abstract underlying order.
